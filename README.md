# EvolutionCars
A simulation of 2D cars driving on a terrain using a genetic algorithm to improve them each generation

# Prerequisites
You will need the SFML and Box2D libraries on your system and properly link it when compiling this project.

# How to use
After compiling, simply run the program.



By pressing the space button you can switch between displaying the cars or displaying statistics about every generation.
When showing statistics, the simulation will advance much faster. So use this feature if you want to skip ahead without waiting for the cars to finish their driving.
